# OneWheel Monitor (iOS)

![Screenshot](/Art/screen.png?raw=true)

Stay aware of your OneWheel+'s speed, battery, and foot sensor state with an earbud.

## Motivation

+ Let's not whip out a phone to check the battery (You're wearing gloves, right? :) ).
+ Let's not unknowingly blow past pushback and die.
+ Let's prevent nosedives and collect enough data to diagnose why they happen.

## Early days!

This is super early work and I fully agree that:

1. It's ugly
2. The synthesized speech alerts are grating

But still don't hesitate to open an issue and I (or one of you!) can get right to it.
